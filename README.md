# Homework 3B - AHP Decision Making

This project uses Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to evaluate and score alternatives based on multiple criteria.

## Files
- `comparisons.xlsx` — Excel file containing the pairwise comparison matrices for criteria and alternatives.
- `index.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with the full AHP computation, including priority vectors, criteria weights, and final school scores.

## Process
- Loaded pairwise comparison data from `comparisons.xlsx`.
- Computed priority vectors for each criterion.
- Computed criteria weights.
- Calculated final scores for the alternatives.

## Final Scores
- A: 0.3787
- B: 0.3629
- C: 0.2585
