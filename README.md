## Files
- `comparisons.xlsx` — Excel file containing pairwise comparison matrices for criteria and alternatives.
- `index.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook performing AHP calculations: priority vectors, criteria weights, and final scores.
- `requirements.txt` — List of libraries needed to run the notebook.

## Process
- Loaded pairwise comparison data from `comparisons.xlsx`.
- Computed priority vectors for each criterion.
- Computed overall criteria weights.
- Calculated final scores for the alternatives (schools).

## Final Scores
| School | Score  |
|--------|--------|
| A      | 0.3787 |
| B      | 0.3629 |
| C      | 0.2585 |
